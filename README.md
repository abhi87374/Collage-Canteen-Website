# Our Canteen Website

## Description

Our Canteen Website aims to provide fast and efficient services to college students, staff, and other users. Traditionally, people need to go to the canteen, place their orders, and wait in long queues. With this website, users can follow a simple process to order their food items without the hassle of waiting in queues.

A canteen facility is a supplementary system provided by organizations for their employees or students. Managing a canteen manually for large numbers of users is impractical. Our website offers a user-friendly interface for multiple food outlets, menu design, billing features, and much more. Implementing such a system ensures the operation of the canteen and kitchen is efficient and quick.

## Features

- **Contact Page**: Users can contact the admin and check their queue number for order time estimation.
